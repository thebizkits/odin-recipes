        <h2>What Is It For</h2>
        <p>Should you suspect to be inflicted by an unexplainable infatuation especially towards a person just met, it is wise to assume that you are put on a spell.</p>
        <p>This potion recipe, when done meticulously, does wonders to counteract even the strongest of love potions. Ingredients may only be gathered within an hour on a new moon's peak. Past the gather period and one risks of weakening its potency.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Two pairs of eyes of male gnats, raw</li>
            <li>Chamomile, three buds</li>
            <li>A pinch of powdered charcoal</li>
            <li>A love letter from an ex lover, cut by hand one inch squared</li>
            <li>Owl heart, minced</li>
            <li>Talc powder, about a teaspoon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>Combine all ingredients except the heart of an owl. Best if combined in a cast iron bowl. Heat the bowl over open fire. Once you see smoke, stir vigorously until chamomile buds sweat. Get bowl off the fire and add the minced heart. Let ferment for a fortnight.</p>
