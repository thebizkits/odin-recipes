An Odin Project - Recipes

When I first realized that the first project on The Odin Project
was an html site for recipes, I got goosebumps.

You see, just a few days ago, I stumbled an odd looking book. 
The hard leather dried up and crooked cradling thick papers that
look like they were made of fibers I haven't seen before. The pages 
are mostly stained while the spine bound them tight still. 

Inside the pages are handwritten notes and colored sketches 
that looked medieval. Almost as if there's magic to it. 

My suspicions were correct. At closer inspection, the book is filled
with strange recipes mentioning ingredients I've only seen 
in fantastical pop culture.

I am inclined to believe that this book wasn't a coincidence but
meant to find its way to me to get the recipes published.
